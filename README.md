# ESG_Environmental_Scores_Signals_vs_Substance
This project studies whether ESG Environmental score improvements reflect real environmental progress or disclosure effects. Using industry- and year-adjusted carbon and financial signals, an interpretable ML model predicts ESG changes. Model residuals are used to identify potential greenwashing behavior across industries.
